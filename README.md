Python (seaborn/matplotlib): Advanced statistical visuals.

Combined Insigths from all 3 datasets

1.Pollution and Agricultural Productivity:

• Urban and industrial states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal have higher
pollution levels, potentially affecting agricultural health and productivity. High levels of
RSPM and SPM in states like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh suggest the need for stricter
environmental regulations.

2.Impact of Environmental Conditions on Agriculture:

• Crop-specific analyses reveal distinct nutrient requirements and climatic preferences.
For example, rice requires more nitrogen, which could influence fertilization strategies
especially in regions with high rainfall that enhances nutrient uptake.

• Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall play critical roles
in determining the suitability of crops for specific regions. Tailoring crop selection and
agricultural practices to these environmental conditions can significantly boost
productivity and sustainability

3.State-Specific Agricultural Production:

• High agricultural production is noted in states like Uttar Pradesh (leading in overall production),
Punjab, and West Bengal. However, the high pollution levels in these states also highlight the
importance of integrating pollution control measures with agricultural policies.

• Cleaner states like Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkim show potential for sustainable agriculture due
to lower pollution levels, despite lower overall agricultural output.

4.Trends in Agricultural Production:

• There is a clear upward trend in total agricultural production over the years, demonstrating the
effectiveness of modern agricultural techniques and policy interventions. However, periodic
fluctuations due to factors such as climate change and economic conditions emphasize the need
for resilient agricultural practices.

5.Policy Implications and Recommendations:

• Enhanced pollution control measures are crucial, especially in high-production states, to mitigate
the impact of pollutants on crop health and yields.

• Policies should encourage the adaptation of agricultural practices to local environmental
conditions, leveraging data on crop nutrient requirements and climatic preferences to maximize
yields and reduce waste.

• The adoption of sustainable and precision agriculture practices can further improve the efficiency
and environmental footprint of farming activities.

Effect of pollution in production:

• Rice Production: Shows a moderate positive correlation with NO2, indicating that higher
NO2 levels might be associated with increased rice production in some states. This
correlation could be influenced by factors such as industrial activities that coincide with
agricultural regions.

• Wheat Production: Exhibits strong positive correlations with RSPM and SPM. This
suggests that areas with higher levels of particulate matter have higher wheat
production. This might reflect agricultural intensity in more industrialized or urbanized
areas, where both pollution and agricultural productivity are high.
